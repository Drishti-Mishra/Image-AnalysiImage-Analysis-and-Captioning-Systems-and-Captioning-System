# Image-Analysis-and-Captioning-Systems
Key Skills:
Python · Transformers (ViT-GPT2) · FastAPI · Torch · Image Dataset from Kaggle

Project Highlights:
Developed an AI model to generate descriptive captions for images using the ViT-GPT2 architecture.

Used Hugging Face’s VisionEncoderDecoderModel, combining ViT as encoder and GPT-2 as decoder.

Trained the model on a dataset of 3,000 images collected from Kaggle.

Utilized transformers and torch libraries for deep learning tasks.

Built REST APIs using FastAPI for image upload and caption generation.

Integrated frontend using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

Processed image files using Pillow for input compatibility.

Deployed locally with Uvicorn for real-time image captioning
